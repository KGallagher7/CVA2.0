## About the CVA2.0

The Climate Vulnerability Assessment (CVA) was originally performed by the Northeast Fisheries Science Center in 2015. This original work, which was later replicated by all the National Marine Fisheries Service regions, used expert opinions to rank how target species would be impacted by future climate change using both exposure and sensitivity attributes. For the original CVA in the northeast US, experts ranked how much change species would be exposed to using large glocal ocean model forecasts and how sensitive they would be to these changes. This resulted in a single exposure and sensitivity score for each species, which was combined to give an overall vulnerability score. Experts were also asked to rank the directionality of climate impacts. The original methods are described in [Morrison et al 2015](https://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/Assets/ecosystems/climate/documents/TM%20OSF3.pdf) and (Hare et al 2016)[https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0146756], and the original results for the northeast shelf can be found in (Hare et al 2016)[https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0146756]. CVA results for all regions can be explored using the (NOAA CVA Tool)[https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/data-tools/climate-vulnerability-assessment-tool].
