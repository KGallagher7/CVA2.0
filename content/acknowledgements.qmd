The CVA2.0 project is funded by the Inflation Reduction Act. 

This project would not have been possible without the dedication and hardwork of countless individuals aboard the federal and state-run survey programs and the NOAA Observer program. 

Many thanks to the following state-run programs for contributing data:
* Northeast Area Monitoring and Assessment Program (NEAMAP)
* Maine-New Hampshire Inshore Trawl Survey
* Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries Bottom Trawl Survey
* New Jersey Ocean Stock Assessment Survey
