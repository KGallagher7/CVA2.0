### About this book 
This book was written to document the methods used to develop the next iteration of the Climate Vulnerability Assessment. The CVA2.0 will be spatially explicit, following methods from Boyce et al 2022 and 2024, while maintaining the expert groups used to help define important life history attributes used in Morrison et al 2015 and Hare et al 2016. 

Once complete, this book will also house documentation related to the R package under development used in this work and the results from species distribution models used in the assessment.
